## Dataset 
For this project we are using the ENRON Email dataset. The size of the dataset is 1.7GB and here is the link to download the entire dataset.

Link - http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/

## Steps to Run the project 
1. Download the dataset using the link provided and extract the zip file. 
2. Once the dataset is unziped and ready, download all the 5 python notebook(.ipynb) files.
3. Make sure that the notebooks and dataset are under the same folder. 
4. Now start running all the notebooks one after the other and make sure to follow the instruction commented in each notebooks.
5. After running the S2 notebook a new enron.csv file will be created and after running the S3 notebook a Enron_29_Features.csv will be created. 

    Note: We have summarized the resutls of first 3 python notebooks (S1, S2, S3) into two different csv files.

    Enron_29_Features.csv - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nl94ImVxrvKnTvJYc9XW8DT0Uoyz7Tmz/view?usp=share_link

6. If you want to skip running the first 3 notebooks you can download the two csv files and place them under the same folder where the code is present.
7. Now simplt run the S4A and S4B files and you should be able to generate all the models and their outputs.
